Scenario: user should not able to claim a legacy profile more than once 
	Given _2rm_ user is registered in login dot gov

	When _2rm_ user enters proper legacy domain name and password 
	Then _2rm_ user should have their corresponding role migrated

Scenario:
System should throw error if one or the other data fields has incorrect data 
	Given _3rm_ user signs in 
	And _3rm_ user nagivates to role migration page 
	When _3rm_ user enters incorrect legacy username only 
	Then _3rm_ user should see proper error message 
	When _3rm user enters incorrect passowrd 
	Then _3rm_ user should see proper password error message 
	When _3rm_ user enters incorrect domain name

	Given _7rm_ user signs in 
	And _7rm_ user nagivates to role migration page 
	When _7rm_ user enters cfda as domain name

	Then _7rm user should get role not supported error 


@8 #12 on confluence doc
Scenario: User should be presented an error message for maximum password use attempts
	Given _8rm_ user is registered in login dot gov 
	And _8rm_ user signs in 
	And _8rm_ user nagivates to role migration page 
	And _8rm_ user enters proper legacy domain name and password 
	When _8rm_ user enters incorrect password three times
